CS-E5875 – High-Throughput Bioinformatics  
2026

## Course overview

This repository collects the materials and exercise work for the Aalto course **CS-E5875 High-Throughput Bioinformatics**.  
The focus is on understanding modern high-throughput biological data (e.g. genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, pharmacomics) and learning how to analyze them with computational and statistical methods.


## Learning outcomes

After completing the course, you should:

- **Understand high-throughput data**: know what kinds of high-throughput assays exist and what biological questions they can answer.
- **Know core computational methods**: be familiar with common algorithms and statistical models for analyzing biological and biomedical data.
- **Apply methods in practice**: be able to implement and run analysis workflows on real biological datasets (e.g. viral genomes, protein sequences, gene ontology).
- **Continue studying the field**: have the theoretical and practical background to follow more advanced courses or literature in bioinformatics and computational biology.

In short, the course provides a **basic but solid understanding of high-throughput data** and gives you **hands-on skills** to analyze them in real biological problems.


## Course content

The course introduces computational and statistical methods for analyzing modern high-throughput biological data and their use in systems biology. Topics include, for example:

- **Sequence analysis**: nucleotide and protein sequence statistics, open reading frames (ORFs), Markov models, similarity search and alignment.
- **Probabilistic models for proteins**: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for protein families and function prediction.
- **Functional annotation and ontologies**: working with the Gene Ontology (GO), graph structures, and post-hoc correction of model predictions.
- **High-throughput data types**: principles of genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and pharmacomics data and how they are typically analyzed.

The emphasis is on **practical data analysis** supported by the necessary probabilistic and statistical background.
